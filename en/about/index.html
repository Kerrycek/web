<h1 class="text-center">About vpsFree.cz, z.s.</h1>

<p>vpsFree.cz is a <span class="orange">non-profit association</span> founded in 2008 to host virtual servers (VPS) for its members. Non-profit association means that every member has right to participate and influence how it's run. It is in a contrast to commercial hostings where every customer has to respect hard rules or leave.</p>

<p>When our member sees some things which could be done better or changed, he can get involved. His activity is welcomed. It doesn't mean that companies or another organisations can't join us. It is very convenient for them too. We do mutual job here and we don't want to make profit on each other.</p>

<p>Our Organization has been founded as a direct reaction to <span class="orange">inflexible</span> services and <span class="orange">exorbitant prices</span> of commercial hostings in Czech Republic and ever worse situation in Slovak Republic. Therefore we are trying to run our servers with more care than commercial providers and also with maximum transparency.</p>

<p>We do not hide anything, all information about vpsFree.cz is <span class="orange">public</span>. We have a lot of communication channels â€“ <a href="https://kb.vpsfree.cz/informace/komunikace" target="_blank">contact our community</a>! We want our members and public to be able to look inside our organization.</p>
